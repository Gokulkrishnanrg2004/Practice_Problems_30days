/*

You have been given a sorted array/list 'arr' consisting of ‘n’ elements. You are also given an integer ‘k’.



Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you.



For example, if 'arr' = [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 8], then after rotating 'arr' at index 3, the array will be 'arr' = [7, 8, 1, 3, 5].



Now, your task is to find the index at which ‘k’ is present in 'arr'.



Note :
1. If ‘k’ is not present in 'arr', then print -1.
2. There are no duplicate elements present in 'arr'. 
3. 'arr' can be rotated only in the right direction.


Example:
Input: 'arr' = [12, 15, 18, 2, 4] , 'k' = 2

Output: 3

Explanation:
If 'arr' = [12, 15, 18, 2, 4] and 'k' = 2, then the position at which 'k' is present in the array is 3 (0-indexed).
